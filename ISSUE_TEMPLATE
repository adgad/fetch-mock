Check the troubleshooting guide and read the API docs before raising an issue

Provide code that recreates the issue you're having. Ideally either
    - recreate the problem with a failing test and submit a PR
    - create a repo with a minimal test case using your build/test setup, and 
      link to this in the issue

Both the above may seem like a lot of work, but the easier you make it for me to 
recreate the bug, the sooner it'll get fixed.
